#### 👋🏼 Hello, I'm Prajna

I'm currently in my third year student at [MIT Manipal](https://manipal.edu/mit.html), pursuing a Bachelor's in Data Science.

A fullstack developer who loves building minimal, modern and beautiful websites, mobile apps, and user interfaces. I am always open to collaborating on projects and innovative/disruptive ideas.

<!-- Currently exploring ios development ☕️ -->

Open for part/full-time internship opportunities or junior positions to work with startups on developing products/softwares.
